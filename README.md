# ⚾ Interactive Baseball Scorecard  

I've been looking all over for an easy-to-use interactive baseball scorecard, with little luck.
The goal of this project is to creat just that. It will replicate the look of a paper scorecard.
This project can also be considered a learning exercise for me, so progress might be slow.

A quick disclaimer: I try to avoid using AI whenever I can, but you might see I've used it to format this README.md and the ROADMAP.md.
As for the code itself, I'm writing it all myself, but I will occasionally use AI to help me out when I can't figure something out.
