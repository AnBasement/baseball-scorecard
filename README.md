# ⚾ Interactive Baseball Scorecard  

I've been looking all over for an easy-to-use interactive baseball scorecard, with little luck.
The goal of this project is to creat just that. It will replicate the look of a paper scorecard.
This project can also be considered a learning exercise for me, so progress might be slow.
